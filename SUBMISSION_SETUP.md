2. Create a new folder named "OctWave 2.0 Submissions"
3. Open the folder and copy its ID from the URL
   - URL format: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{FOLDER_ID}`
   - Example: If URL is `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC...XYZ`, the ID is `1ABC...XYZ`
4. Save this **FOLDER_ID** for later

---

## Step 2: Create Google Sheets for Submissions

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Name it "OctWave 2.0 Submissions"
4. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL

5. Save this **SHEET_ID** for later

---

## Step 3: Set up Google Apps Script

### 3.1 Create New Project

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Name it "OctWave Submission Handler"

### 3.2 Add the Script Code

1. Delete the default code in the editor
2. Copy the entire content from `google-apps-script-submit.js` file in your project root
3. Paste it into the Google Apps Script editor

### 3.3 Configure the Script

Find these lines at the top of the script and update them:

```javascript
const SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE'; // Paste your Sheet ID from Step 2
const DRIVE_FOLDER_ID = 'YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_HERE'; // Paste your Folder ID from Step 1
```

**Example:**
```javascript
const SHEET_ID = '1DEF...789';
const DRIVE_FOLDER_ID = '1ABC...XYZ';
```

### 3.4 Test the Setup

1. In the Google Apps Script editor, select the function `testSetup` from the dropdown
2. Click **Run** (play button)
3. **First time only:** You'll be asked to authorize the script
   - Click "Review Permissions"
   - Select your Google account
   - Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to OctWave Submission Handler (unsafe)"
   - Click "Allow"
4. Check the execution log (View ‚Üí Logs)

- **Execute as:** "Me (your email)"
- **Who has access:** "Anyone"

### 4.3 Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. You may need to authorize again - click "Authorize access"
3. Copy the **Web app URL**
   - It will look like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfy...xyz/exec`
4. **Important:** Save this URL - you'll need it for the Next.js configuration

---

## Step 5: Configure Next.js Environment

### 5.1 Create/Update .env.local

1. In your project root (`D:\Octwave-2.0`), create or update `.env.local`
2. Add the following line:

```env
GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_SUBMIT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
```

**Replace** `YOUR_SCRIPT_ID` with the actual URL you copied in Step 4.3

**Example:**
```env
GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_SUBMIT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfy...xyz/exec
```

### 5.2 Verify Environment File

Your complete `.env.local` should now have:

```env
# Registration API (existing)
GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/REGISTRATION_SCRIPT_ID/exec

# Submission API (new)
GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_SUBMIT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/SUBMISSION_SCRIPT_ID/exec

## üîí Security & Permissions

### File Permissions
- All uploaded files are set to "Anyone with link can view"
- Only you (the script owner) can edit or delete files
- Team folders are created automatically

### Access Control
- Google Apps Script runs with your permissions
- Teams cannot access each other's submissions
- Only submission details are logged to Sheets

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Error: "Server configuration error"
- **Cause:** `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_SUBMIT_URL` not set in `.env.local`
- **Fix:** Add the environment variable and restart the dev server

### Error: "Failed to upload files"
- **Cause:** Google Apps Script configuration issue
- **Fix:**
  1. Check `SHEET_ID` and `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` in the script
  2. Run `testSetup()` function in Google Apps Script
  3. Check execution logs for errors

### Files Not Appearing in Drive
- **Cause:** Wrong folder ID or permissions
- **Fix:**
  1. Verify `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` is correct
  2. Ensure you have edit access to the folder
  3. Re-run `testSetup()` function

### Sheets Not Updating
- **Cause:** Wrong sheet ID or permissions
- **Fix:**
  1. Verify `SHEET_ID` is correct
  2. Ensure you have edit access to the sheet
  3. Check if "Submissions" tab was created

### "File size must not exceed 50MB"
- **Cause:** File is too large
- **Fix:** Ask teams to compress their files or increase the limit in:
  - `src/app/api/submit/route.ts` (line 37)
  - Google Apps Script has a 50MB limit (cannot be changed)

## üîÑ Updating the Script

If you need to update the Google Apps Script:

1. Go to your script in [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Make your changes
3. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **Manage deployments**
4. Click ‚úèÔ∏è (Edit) on your deployment
5. Change "Version" to "New version"
6. Click **Deploy**
7. **Important:** The URL stays the same - no need to update `.env.local`

---

## üìù Important Notes

1. **File Size Limit:** Maximum 50MB per file (Google Apps Script limitation)
2. **File Types:**
   - Report: PDF only
   - Presentation: PPT or PPTX only
3. **Duplicate Submissions:** If the same team submits again, files will be added to the same folder
4. **Backup:** Google Drive automatically versions files, so previous submissions are not lost
5. **Storage:** Files count against your Google Drive storage quota
